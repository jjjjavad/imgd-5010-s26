# IMGD 5010 - Assignment 2
In the Fluxus movement art was sometimes created using *instructions*, whether for performers, an audience, an artist, or some combination of all three. Most computational art is also created via instruction, however, various abstractions in computer programming tend to hide these instructions; that is, computer programs can become complex enough that it is difficult to understand what the underlying instructions are without spending significant time analyzing the source code of an application.

For this assignment, you will create a set of instructions and then realize them in p5.js. Your goal is to both create something that is aesthetically interesting to you, and where your audience can potentially see the underlying instructions.

## Deliverables
1. Write out a set of instructions for your static (not animated) visual composition. THIS SHOULD NOT BE COMPUTER CODE. Rather, in English, write out the instructions you would like the computer to follow.
2. Create a program  in the [p5.js editor](https://editor.p5js.org) that realizes your instructions. Make sure to create an account with the editor and save your program (you can just use your GitHub login for this).
3. Send your program to a fellow classmate to analyze. First, ask them to view the rendered output and then tell you what they think the instructions are (in English, not code). Have them write this down. Then, share what your original instructions were and ask them if the rendered output makes sense / is expected given the instructions. Finally, share your code with the user ask them if they would have translated your instructions to code any differently. 
4. Create a repo for your code. Add a README.md that includes your initial English instructions and any goals / influences you had for your composition. Add a feedback.md file that includes the feedback / responses you received from your classmate.
5. Enter the url for your repo in the associated Canvas assignment.
